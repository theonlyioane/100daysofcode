# 100daysofcode

###Day 1
I started with a simple tutorial that allowed me to change content based on a users click. Tomorrow I want to automate the animation so that the user does not have to click in order to see the animation.

I've also added in notes to my JS so that I'm understanding the concepts that I'm implementing.

###Day 2
For this excercise I wanted to mock up the action of a user clicking a button and being able to reference different content withing the same module. I was able to do that by setting functions with different strings, and tieing them within the same elementId
